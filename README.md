# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction-Analysis
To perform a regression analysis for predicting Black Friday sales, you'll need historical data on Black Friday sales along with relevant features that might influence sales.
Data Collection: Gather historical Black Friday sales data along with other relevant features like demographics, advertising spend, promotions, weather conditions, etc.
Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Feature Selection/Engineering: Analyze the features to select the most relevant ones for the regression model. You may also create new features that could potentially improve prediction accuracy.
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate regression model based on your data and problem requirements. Common choices include linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, etc.
Training the Model: Train the chosen regression model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), etc. You can also visualize the predicted vs. actual sales values.
Fine-tuning: If necessary, fine-tune the model hyperparameters to improve its performance.
Prediction: Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, use it to predict Black Friday sales for future dates.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model into production for making real-time predictions or use it for ad-hoc analysis.
Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance in production and update it periodically if necessary to adapt to changing trends or data patterns.
